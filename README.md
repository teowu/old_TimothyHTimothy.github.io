# Before my Homepage is constructed...*IT* is the homepage...

Hello there! 

I'm Master Obi... **Timothy Haoning Wu**, a junior college student from Peking University, now researching on Computer Visions. My major concerns are **Image Restoration and Enhancement**, **Computational Photography**, **Image and Video Quality Assessments**. 

I'm still finishing my undergraduate courses.

## If you're interested...

In Fall 2020 (this Fall), I will be applying for graduate on Computer Vision tasks to continue my exporations on the topics shown above. On the mean time, I will also be considering my careers and future developments and follow some practical projects on my favored topics.

If you would like to know more about me, please see my [`Curriculum Vitae`](null).

## Research Experiences

Since Fall 2019, I have joined Visual Inference and Evaluation (VIE) group in Peking University, under the instruction of Asso. Professor Tingting Jiang, IEEE Fellow, conducting research on Deep Image Quality Assessment methods. Now, I am working on reconstructing images from many distortions: Degradation, Noising, Artifacts, and try to combine reconstructing methodology with QA knowledges.





### Research Project: Super Resolution (Nov 2019 - Now)

Advisors: Tingting Jiang (PKU), Ming-Hsuan Yang (UC Merced).

#### Start with RankSRGAN

In Winter 2019, after surveying on IQA methods, I re-implemented and tried some on RankSRGAN algorithms, learning the full pipeline and potential novel breakthroughs on Super Resolution.

- Introducing real human MOS rank pairs to replace the IQA-pseudo rank pairs.
- Based on exactly same Backbone of IQA loss module and Discriminator module, proposed a mechanism combining both.

This job did not create much quantitative result but explores the possibilities of Super Resolution.



#### Dual Resolution Domain Matching (DRDM) on Unsupervised SISR

In Feb. 2020, I joined NTIRE2020 Real-World Super Resolution challenge, proposed and achieved very good result on *IQA-rank* (**IQA Score 4.06, the second among over 20 teams**). With my personal strength and much courses this semester, I failed to eliminate the unknown noise patterns before the deadline of the competition and failed the evaluation of human rank.

In May 2020, I added MixCorrupt module, removed the noise patterns and achieved **better generalization result**. You may refer to [`DRDM`](https://github.com/TimothyHTimothy/NADU-DMDR) to see my progress on this topic.



#### AIM Real SR Track 1&2&3

Now I'm participating in AIM2020 Real-World SR Track 1,2,3(x2,x3,x4) and achieved comparable results on modifying the existing State-of-the-Art networks, such as 

I'm still working on becoming the State-of-the-Art.

*May the force be with you. Always.*
