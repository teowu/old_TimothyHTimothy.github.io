Hello there!

I'm Timothy Haoning Wu, a junior student from Peking University, now researching on image restoration and enhancement, computational photography, image and video quality assessments, and, of course, still finishing my undergraduate lectures.

## Research Experiences

Since Fall 2019, I have joined Visual Inference and Evaluation (VIE) group in Peking University, under the instruction of Asso. Professor Tingting Jiang, IEEE Fellow, conducting research on Deep Image Quality Assessment methods. Now, I am working on reconstructing images from many distortions: Degradation, Noising, Artifacts, and try to combine reconstructing methodology with Quality Assessment knowledges.

### Super TaskSuper Resolution

In Spring 2020, I joined NTIRE 2020 Real-World Super Resolution challenge.
